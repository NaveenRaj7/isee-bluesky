<p>In this blog we will let you know about the technical challenges we faced during the development of Activity Monitoring application, benefits and challenges we faced working in a team. We have come to the end of the course ISEE 2017 by creating the android App.
	As we all know to have successful software project there includes some key factors, overcome the technical challenges.to make client happy most important is to deliver the product on-time with customer satisfaction, proper usage of budget to finish the project.
First challenge started when customer started talking about the requirements, at first place we understood wrongly. Then step by step we got the correct and lucid requirement because we have to satisfy customer need
</p>

<p>We used to have weekly meetings, at the starting we started collecting user stories and nice to have requirements which was challenging further in developing. 
We have jotted all user stories in Zen hub and we used it as reference to work further in the project.</p>

<h2>Technical challenges</h2>
A quote rightly said by Liu Xiang “Challenges are meant to be met and overcome”
	Hurdles are part of every challenge and without hurdles there is no spark in the project.
We had very quiet few technical challenges such as
<ul> 
<li>Completely understanding the user requirement:</li>
<p>Each person in the team understood the requirement differently, so we had to go again to the customer 
and get the clear picture of what customer needs. What we think our users want and need can be, at most times, 
completely different from what they actually want and need. Effective planning means integrating user input and 
feedback throughout the design and development process.</p>

<li>Android Studio</li>
<p>In the team of four, two people were not aware of the software. 
So it was little challenging to follow the syntax and the software smoothly.</p>

<li>Deleting the Activity from the home screen</li>
<p>We had some issue like the activity was not getting deleted from the database. 
So, minor mistake we had to sit for hours together to find out where was the issue. 
There was no compilation error. If there were errors we can handle it and resolve the issues.</p>
</ul>


<h2><b><u>BLUESKY TEAM</u></b></h2>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/4.jpg" align="middle">

<p>To say about us,we are the team where we think out of box and understand the term teamwork and work towards the project.
We are team team of four,where we don’t had any sorts of disputes in any milestone rather we shared each others view and 
respect the same</p>

<h2><b><u>Challenges faced as a Team</u></b></h2>

<p>There were quite few general challenges as a team. Following are the challenges</p>

<ul>
<li>Time-management:</li>
<p>Work towards this project in a particular time together was the most difficult task than the coding part. 
So finally we used sprints and SCRUM to work in efficient way.</p>
<li>Misunderstanding the requirements:</li>
<p>When you have more people in a team, there comes misinterpreting and understanding the things in different aspects. 
In very first meeting we all had understood completely different from the user. 
But at the later stage we got to know user needs the app for monitoring his/her own activities performed.</p>

<h2><b><u>Benefits the team experienced by working on a software project as a team</u></b></h2>

<p>Team work can be referred to many things: All members working towards a common goal, by the combined action and collaboration of several people, just looking to that perspective it doesn’t mean that people participating in work doesn’t provide us with successful team work.</p>
<p>Looking into the perspective of Software development project, team work can bring numerous benefits to the product created which can in turn lead to increased efficiency, creativity, innovation which all gives us an an good final release.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to working in a team on a project:</p>

<ul>
<li>to learn to plan and organize </li>
<li>to learn to negotiate and compromise </li>
<li>to practice decision-making skills</li>
<li>to gain knowledge from another person</li>
<li>to meet new people</li>
<li>to require less work for each individual </li>
<li>to have fun</li>

<h><b>Benefits</b></h>

<ul>	
<li>To develop a software in an organized way we where introduced to the concept of SCRUM and Sprints</li>
<li>Introduced to new organizational and systematic way of programming a code using github and zenhub</li>
<li>Learned to prioritize the good suggestions among group members, value each decisions and to take healthy 		  criticism.</li>
<li>Introduced to Android studio and its new possibilities.</li>
<li>Customer Preferences: understood how a customer thinks and work according to his requirements.</li>
<li>Analyzing, testing of different developmental phases of a software project.</li>
<li>Finally, working in a software development team helped us understand the importance of team work, group strategies and approaches that can be done effectively for the completion of a software product.</li>
</ul>
