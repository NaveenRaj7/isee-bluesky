<p>The system design is ready and now the most important task is to convert all the design into program coding. In this blog post we will be describing about the Coding conventions, Naming conventions, Storyboard, Implementation, Coloured user interface.</p>

<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>
<p>We are following the coding standards where we have mixture of Java and our own conventions. The main motto of using mixed conventions is that it becomes easy for the developer to use own convention which can be utilised throughout at ease but not violating
 the coding standards.</p>


<p>We have been using Java platform to code the background processes and the XML script language for designing the User Interface in Android Studio. We are using the main concepts like inheritance which enhance the reusability of code,well structured design which support to maintainability and last but not the least coding conventions used by us is readable and related to the project.Our coding conventions will ensure the others to understand what the app does exactly through the program flow.</p>
