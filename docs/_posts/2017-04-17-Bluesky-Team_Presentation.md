<p>Welcome to our team's blog, in this post I'll give a brief introduction of our team and the project we are working on.</p>

<p>The members of team Bluesky:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Jovel Jose, Team Leader</li>
<li>Naveen Raj, Chief Programmer</li>
<li>Alpha Mary Skaria, Designer</li>
<li>Shruti Subramanian, Problem Solving and Testing</li>
</ul>

<p>The term Bluesky is a synonym for creative/visionary and unconstrained by practicalities. We explored for a simple yet stylish name, and zeroed onto the term Bluesky, which not only suits our requirements but also inspires us to work and dream.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jovel for designing this inspiring team logo,</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Our personal motivation is to gain first hand experience in developing a software project by successfully completing the project, and learn to work together as a team in order to solve a real-world problem. Lastly, the best and the most exciting part is developing an Android app and the possibility of publishing it on the play store.</p>

<p>The project we chose to work on is 'Activity Monitoring'. We selected this topic because as students we ourselves were in need of an app which could help us in monitoring our progress in studies & lectures, scheduling tasks, also monitor our project and thesis work.</p>

<h2>Interdisciplinary Skills</h2>
<p>Forming a team was easy for us as we know & understand each other well and we already worked together as a team before. It is essential to balance the skills of one team member with the complementary abilities of other. Our team is blessed with dissimilar skills, which clubbed together makes our team autonomous and self-monitoring. Some members of our group have decision-making, motivational and problem-solving skills, whereas others have the ability to stay calm under pressure. Everyone in the team is open to communicate and ready to accept healthy criticism.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>We shared the roles and responsibilities among us to get successful results. Jovel is Team Leader, he will ensure that all milestones are achieved successfully and on time. I will be responsible for the designing part. Naveen is responsible for the merging and maintaining the code contributed by the team members and Shruti apart from testing the code will oversee that we're on the right path and that no problems arise during the development of the project. Though responsibilities are assigned to each team member, we make sure that we help each other and work together to achieve goals.</p>

<h2>Communication within team</h2>
<p>We are using GitHub to share, merge and update our work and ZenHub to manage our project, Google calendar to schedule meetings, WhatsApp and team meetings for discussion. </p>
 
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>Uncertainty is an inherent part of all projects. We believe in the principle that “We must always be able to predict what’s next and then have the flexibility to evolve”. We plan tasks ahead and fix priorities. Also verify our current status frequently with our customer’s requirements in order to match the expectations of the customer.</p>

<p>It's all for now, will be back soon with a new post on brief introduction to our customer's 'Requirements and Specifications'.</p>
